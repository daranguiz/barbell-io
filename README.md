# barbell-io

A project by Dario Aranguiz and Kashev Dalmia. Can we make a better lifting tracker than fitnotes?

Backend is written with [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), and frontend is written with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Database is [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).

## Requirements

To run, you need [python3](https://docs.python.org/3/). Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and launch at `localhost:5000`.

## TODO

- [ ] Historic 1RM estimation chart
- [ ] Historic wilks estimation chart
- [ ] Historic volume chart
- [ ] Social: search for friends via Facebook, see their progress
- [ ] Frontend: we can do better than default boostrap styling
- [ ] Deployment: get this bad boy online

See [issues](https://github.com/daranguiz/barbell-io/issues) for more up-to-date todo.
